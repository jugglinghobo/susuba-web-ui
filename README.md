susuba-web-ui
=============

This is the web frontend for [susuba](https://github.com/rathrio/susuba).

It is built with [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and runs on [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/).

To see our progress, check out the stable versions on heroku: [susuba-web-ui.herokuapp.com](http://susuba-web-ui.herokuapp.com),
or contribute to the project by forking it and submitting a pull request.

###Please Note
This project is still in a very early stage and the code is highly unstable. Until versioning is introduced,
all changes can cause the code to break. __Use at your own risk__.

#####Currently Problematic
  - data store points to localhost, which requires you to run the [susuba](https://github.com/rathrio/susuba) app locally.
    To do so, follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/rathrio/susuba#susuba).
